# Investigating Horizontal Neutral Winds using Scanning Doppler Imaging and All Sky Cameras

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction 

The project aimed at investigating how the Aurora Borealis captured by the All Sky Cameras (ASC) influence the horizontal neutral winds measured by Scanning Doppler Imager (SCANDI). The main objective is to create a video which superimposes SCANDI and ASC videos in order to investigate how the windfield changes as the northern lights change. 

## Project Directory

All the files are stored in FPI-winds directory. This folder contains all the functions, notebooks and scripts coded in this project. It contains the "FPImain.m" file which executes all the smaller functions to create an ASC and a SCANDI video. The python script "comb_vids.py" executes code to combine these videos into one superimposed video of the two. This directory also contains some data files in txt format and subfolders which contain other textfile datasets and ASC pictures for selected dates. 
SCANDI_animations folder contains some saved examples of final videos for certain tested dates. 

## Requirements 

Do not change the structure of the directory and subfolders and its content. Do change the directories in the lines of code to your own directory in which the FPI-winds folder is saved in.

#### Required modules 

Python :
    *moviepy
    *scipy

MATLAB :
    *Signal processing Toolbox
    *Phased Array System Toolbox
    *Image Processing Toolbox
    *Mapping Toolbox

## Reproducing Results

In order to execute the the scripts, run the following functions:

1. Open MATLAB and press run button to execute FPImain.m
2. Once the two output videos have been saved, open a python editor and execute comb_vids.py
